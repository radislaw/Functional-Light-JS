Функциональное программирование (ФП) не является новой концепцией. Оно существовало почти всю историю программирования. Однако - и я не уверен, что это справедливо сказано, но! - оно, конечно, не оказался основной темой концепции в общем мире разработчиков, до последних нескольких лет. However -- and I'm not sure it's fair to say, but! -- it sure hasn't seemed like as mainstream of a concept in the overall developer world until perhaps the last few years. Я думаю, что ФП больше относится к академической области.


Но все меняется. Интерес к ФП растет, не только на уровне языков, но даже библиотек и фреймворков. Вы очень хорошо читаете этот текст, потому что вы наконец поняли, что ФП - это то, что вы больше не можете игнорировать. Или, может быть, вы похожи на меня, и пытались много раз изучить ФП, но изо всех сил пытались пробраться через все термины или математические обозначения.

But that's all changing. A groundswell of interest is growing around FP, not just at the languages level but even in libraries and frameworks. You very well might be reading this text because you've finally realized FP is something you can't ignore any longer. Or maybe you're like me and you've tried to learn FP many times before but struggled to wade through all the terms or mathematical notation.

Цель первой главы - заложить основу для ответа на такие вопросы, как: «Почему я должен использовать стиль FP в моём коде?» и «Как функционально-Light JavaScript сравнивается с тем, что другие говорят о FP?» Начиная с главы 2 в остальной части книги, мы начнем раскрывать, по частям, методы и образцы написания JS в стиле функционального света.

This first chapter's purpose is to lay the groundwork to answer questions like: "Why should I use FP style with my code?" and "How does Functional-Light JavaScript compare to what others say about FP?" Starting with Chapter 2 throughout the rest of the book, we'll begin uncovering, piece by piece, the techniques and patterns of writing JS in functional-light style.

## At A Glance

Давайте вкратце проиллюстрируем понятие «Функционально-Light JavaScript» с моментальным снимком кода до и после. Рассматривать:

Let's briefly illustrate the notion of "Functional-Light JavaScript" with a before-and-after snapshot of code. Consider:

```js
var numbers = [4,10,0,27,42,17,15,-6,58];
var faves = [];
var magicNumber = 0;

pickFavoriteNumbers();
calculateMagicNumber();
outputMsg();                // Магическое число: 42

// ***************

function calculateMagicNumber() {
    for (let fave of faves) {
        magicNumber = magicNumber + fave;
    }
}

function pickFavoriteNumbers() {
    for (let num of numbers) {
        if (num >= 10 && num <= 20) {
            faves.push( num );
        }
    }
}

function outputMsg() {
    var msg = `Магическое число: ${magicNumber}`;
    console.log( msg );
}
```

Теперь рассмотрим совсем другой стиль, который выполняет точно такой же результат:
Now consider a very different style that accomplishes exactly the same outcome:

```js
var sumOnlyFavorites = FP.compose( [
    FP.filterReducer( FP.gte( 10 ) ),
    FP.filterReducer( FP.lte( 20 ) )
] )( sum );

var printMagicNumber = FP.pipe( [
    FP.reduce( sumOnlyFavorites, 0 ),
    constructMsg,
    console.log
] );

var numbers = [4,10,0,27,42,17,15,-6,58];

printMagicNumber( numbers );        // Магическое число: 42

// ***************

function sum(x,y) { return x + y; }
function constructMsg(v) { return `Магическое число: ${v}`; }
```
Как только вы поймете FP и Functional-Light, это, скорее всего, так, как вы бы *читали* и мысленно обрабатывали этот второй фрагмент:
Once you understand FP and Functional-Light, this is likely how you'd *read* and mentally process that second snippet:

> Сначала мы создаем функцию `sumOnlyFavorites (..)`, которая представляет собой комбинацию из трех других функций. Мы объединяем два фильтра, один проверяет, больше или равно значение 10, а другой - меньше или равно 20. Затем мы включаем редуктор `sum (..)` в состав преобразователя. Then we include the `sum(..)` reducer in the transducer composition. Полученная функция `sumOnlyFavorites (..)` является редуктором, который проверяет, проходит ли значение оба фильтра, и если да, добавляет значение к значению аккумулятора.
>
> Затем мы создаем еще одну функцию `printMagicNumber (..)`, которая сначала сводит список чисел, используя редуктор `sumOnlyFavorites (..)`, который мы только что определили, в результате получим сумму только чисел, которые передавали *любимые* проверки. Затем `printMagicNumber (..)` передает окончательную сумму в `constructMsg (..)`, которая создает строковое значение, которое, наконец, переходит в `console.log (..)`. Then we make another function called `printMagicNumber(..)` which first reduces a list of numbers using that `sumOnlyFavorites(..)` reducer we just defined, resulting in a sum of only numbers that passed the *favorite* checks.

All those moving pieces *speak* to an FP developer in ways that likely seem highly unfamiliar to you right now. This book will help you *speak* that same kind of reasoning so that it's as readable to you as any other code, if not more so!

A few other quick remarks about this code comparison:

* It's likely that for many readers, the former snippet feels closer to comfortable/readable/maintainable than the latter snippet. It's entirely OK if that's the case. You're in exactly the right spot. I'm confident that if you stick it out through the whole book, and practice everything we talk about, that second snippet will eventually become a lot more natural, maybe even preferable!

* Maybe you would have done the task significantly or entirely different from either snippet presented. That's OK, too. This book won't be prescriptive in telling you that you should do something a specific way. Our goal is to illustrate the pros/cons of various patterns and enable you to make those decisions. By the end of this book, how you would approach the task may fall a little closer to the second snippet than it does right now.

* It's also possible that you're already a seasoned FP developer who's scanning through the start of this book to see if it has anything useful for you to read. That second snippet certainly has some bits that are quite familiar. But I'm also betting that you thought, "Hmmm, I wouldn't have done it *that* way..." a couple of times. That's OK, and entirely reasonable.

    This is not a traditional, canonical FP book. We'll at times seem quite heretical in our approaches. We're seeking to strike a pragmatic balance between the clear undeniable benefits of FP, and the need to ship workable, maintainable JS without having to tackle a daunting mountain of math/notation/terminology. This is not *your* FP, it's "Functional-Light JavaScript".

Whatever your reasons for reading this book, welcome!

## Confidence

I have a very simple premise that sort of underlies everything I do as a teacher of software development (in JavaScript): code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand. The reverse is true, also: code that you don't understand is code you can't trust. Furthermore, if you cannot trust or understand your code, then you can't have any confidence whatsoever that the code you write is suitable to the task. You run the program and basically just cross your fingers.

What do I mean by trust? I mean that you can verify, by reading and reasoning, not just executing, that you understand what a piece of code *will* do; you aren't just relying on what it *should* do. Perhaps more often than we should, we tend to rely on verification of our program's correctness by running test suites. I don't mean to suggest tests are bad. But I do think we should aspire to be able to understand our code well enough that we know the test suite will pass before it runs.

The techniques that form the foundation of FP are designed from the mindset of having far more confidence over our programs just by reading them. Someone who understands FP, and who's disciplined enough to diligently use throughout their programs, will write code that they **and others** can read and verify that the program will do what they want.

Confidence is also increased when we use techniques that avoid or minimize likely sources of bugs. That's perhaps one of the biggest selling points of FP: FP programs often have fewer bugs, and the bugs that do exist are often in more obvious places, so they're easier to find and fix. FP code tends to be more bug resistant -- certainly not bug proof, though.

As you journey through this book, you will begin to develop more confidence in the code you write, because you will use patterns and practices that are already well-proven; and you'll avoid the most common causes of program bugs!

## Communication

Why is functional programming important? To answer that, we need to take a bigger step back and talk about why programming itself is important.

It may surprise you to hear this, but I don't believe that code is primarily a set of instructions for the computer. As a matter of fact, I think the fact that code instructs the computer is almost a happy accident.

I believe very deeply that the vastly more important role of code is as a means of communication with other human beings.

You probably know by experience that an awful lot of your time spent "coding" is actually spent reading existing code. Very few of us are so privileged as to spend all or most of our time simply banging out all new code and never dealing with code that others (or our past selves) wrote.

It's widely estimated that developers spend 70% of code maintenance time on reading to understand it? That is eye-opening. 70%. No wonder the global average for a programmer's lines of code written per day is about 10. We spend about 7 hours of our day just reading the code to figure out where those 10 lines should go!

I think we should focus a lot more on the readability of our code. And by the way, readability is not just about fewer characters. Readability is actually most impacted by familiarity. [1]

If we are going to spend our time concerned with making code that will be more readable and understandable, FP is central in that effort. The principles of FP are well established, deeply studied and vetted, and provably verifiable. Taking the time to learn and employ these FP principles will ultimately lead to more readily and recognizably familiar code for you and others. The increase in code familiarity, and the expediency of that recognition, will increase code readability.

For example, once you learn what `map(..)` does, you'll be able to almost instantly spot and understand it when you see it in any program. But every time you see a `for` loop, you're going to have to read the whole loop to understand it. The syntax of the `for` loop may be familiar, but the substance of what it's doing is not; that has to be *read*, every time.

By having more code that's recognizable at a glance, and thus spending less time figuring out what the code is doing, our focus is freed up to think about the higher levels of program logic; this is the important stuff that most needs our attention anyway.

FP (at least, without all the terminology weighing it down) is one of the most effective tools for crafting readable code. *That* is why it's so important.

## Readability

Readability is not a binary characteristic. It's a largely subjective human factor describing our relationship to code. And it will naturally vary over time as our skills and understanding evolve. I have experienced effects similar to the following figure, and anecdotally many others I've talked to have as well.

<p align="center">
    <img src="fig17.png" width="600">
</p>

You may just find yourself experiencing similar effects as you work through the book. But take heart; if you stick this out, the curve comes back up!

*Imperative* describes the code most of us probably already write naturally; it's focused on precisely instructing the computer *how* to do something. Declarative code -- the kind we'll be learning to write, which adheres to FP principles -- is code that's more focused on describing the *what* outcome.

Let's revisit the two code snippets earlier in this chapter.

The first snippet is imperative, focused almost entirely on *how* to do the tasks; it's littered with `if` statements, `for` loops, temporary variables, reassignments, value mutations, function calls with side effects, and implicit data flow between functions. You certainly *can* trace through its logic to see how the numbers flow and change to the end state, but it's not at all clear and straightforward.

The second snippet is more declarative; it does away with most of those aforementioned imperative techniques. Notice there's no explicit conditionals, loops, side effects, reassignments, or mutations; instead, it employs well-known (to the FP world, anyway!) and trustable patterns like filtering, reduction, transducing, and composition. The focus shifts from low-level *how* to higher level *what* outcomes.

Instead of messing with an `if` statement to test a number, we delegate that to a well-known FP utility like `gte(..)` (greater-than-or-equal-to), and then focus on the more important task of combining that filter with another filter and a summation function.

Moreover, the flow of data through the second program is explicit:

1. A list of numbers goes into `printMagicNumber(..)`.
2. One at a time those numbers are processed by `sumOnlyFavorites(..)`, resulting in a single number total of only our favorite kinds of numbers.
3. That total is converted to a message string with `constructMsg(..)`.
4. The message string is printed to the console with `console.log(..)`.

You may still feel this approach is convoluted, and that the imperative snippet was easier to understand. You're much more used to it; familiarity has a profound influence on our judgements of readability. By the end of this book, though, you will have internalized the benefits of the second snippet's declarative approach, and that familiarity will spring its readability to life.

I know asking you to believe that at this point is a leap of faith.

It takes a lot more effort, and sometimes more code, to improve its readability as I'm suggesting, and to minimize or eliminate many of the mistakes that lead to bugs. Quite honestly, when I started writing this book, I could never have written (or even fully understood!) that second snippet. As I'm now further along on my journey of learning, it's more natural and comfortable.

If you're hoping that FP refactoring, like a magic silver bullet, will quickly transform your code to be more graceful, elegant, clever, resiliant, and concise -- that it will come easy in the short term -- unfortunately that's just not a realistic expectation.

FP is a very different way of thinking about how code should be structured, to make the flow of data much more obvious and to help your reader follow your thinking. It will take time. This effort is eminently worthwhile, but it can be an arduous journey.

It still often takes me multiple attempts at refactoring a snippet of imperative code into more declarative FP, before I end up with something that's clear enough for me to understand later. I've found converting to FP is a slow iterative process rather than a quick binary flip from one paradigm to another.

I also apply the "teach it later" test to every piece of code I write. After I've written a piece of code, I leave it alone for a few hours or days, then come back and try to read it with fresh eyes, and pretend as if I need to teach or explain it to someone else. Usually, it's jumbled and confusing the first few passes, so I tweak it and repeat!

I'm not trying to dampen your spirits. I really want you to hack through these weeds. I am glad I have. I can finally start to see the curve bending upward towards more readability. The effort has been worth it. It will be for you, too.

## Perspective

We're going to approach FP from the ground up -- it seems to me most other FP texts go the opposite direction: top-down -- and discover the basic foundational principles that I believe formal FPers would admit are the scaffolding for everything they do. But for the most part we'll stay arms length away from most of the intimidating terminology or mathematical notation that can so easily frustrate learners.

I believe it's less important what you call something and more important that you understand what it is and how it works. That's not to say there's no importance to shared terminology -- it undoubtedly eases communication among seasoned professionals. But for the learner, I've found it can be distracting.

So this book will try to focus more on the base concepts and less on the fancy fluff. That's not to say there won't be terminology; there definitely will be. But don't get too wrapped up in the sophisticated words. Wherever necessary, look beyond them to the ideas.

I call the less formal practice herein "Functional-Light Programming" because I think where the formalism of true FP suffers is that it can be quite overwhelming if you're not already accustomed to formal thought. I'm not just guessing; this is my own personal story. Even after teaching FP and writing this book, I can still say that the formalism of terms and notation in FP is very, very diffcult for me to process. I've tried, and tried, and I can't seem to get through much of it.

I know many FPers who believe that the formalism itself helps learning. But I think there's clearly a cliff where that only becomes true once you reach a certain comfort with the formalism. If you happen to already have a math background or even some flavors of CS experience, this may come more naturally to you. But some of us don't, and no matter how hard we try, the formalism keeps getting in the way.

So this book introduces the concepts that I believe FP is built on, but comes at it by giving you a boost from below to climb up the cliff wall, rather than condescendingly shouting down at you from the top, proding you to just figure out how to climb as you go.

## How To Find Balance

If you've been around programming for very long, chances are you've heard the phrase "YAGNI" before: "You Ain't Gonna Need It". This principle primarily comes from extreme programming, and stresses the high risk and cost of building a feature before it's needed.

Sometimes we guess we'll need a feature in the future, build it now believing it'll be easier to do as we build other stuff, then realize we guessed wrong and the feature wasn't needed, or needed to be quite different. Other times we guess right, but build a feature too early, and suck up time from the features that are genuinely needed now; we incur an opportunity cost in diluting our energy.

YAGNI challenges us to remember: even if it's counter intuitive in a situation, we often should postpone building something until it's presently needed. We tend to exaggerate our mental estimates of the future refactoring cost of adding it later when it is needed. Odds are, it won't be as hard to do later as we might assume.

As it applies to functional programming, I would offer this admonition: there will be plenty of interesting and compelling patterns discussed in this text, but just because you find some pattern exciting to apply, it may not necessarily be appropriate to do so in a given part of your code.

This is where I will differ from many formal FPers: just because you *can* apply FP to something doesn't mean you *should* apply FP to it. Moreover, there are many ways to slice a problem, and even though you may have learned a more sophisticated approach that is more "future-proof" to maintenance and extensibility, a simpler FP pattern might be more than sufficient in that spot.

Generally, I'd recommend to seek balance in what you code, and to be conservative in your application of FP concepts as you get the hang of things. Default to the YAGNI principle in deciding if a certain pattern or abstraction will help that part of the code be more readable or if it's just introducing clever sophistication that isn't (yet) warranted.

> Reminder, any extensibility point that’s never used isn’t just wasted effort, it’s likely to also get in your way as well
>
> Jeremy D. Miller @jeremydmiller 2/20/15

Remember, every single line of code you write has a reader cost associated with it. That reader may be another team member, or even your future self. Neither of those readers will be impressed with overly clever, unnecessary sophistication just to show off your FP prowess.

The best code is the code that is most readable in the future because it strikes exactly the right balance between what it can/should be (idealism) and what it must be (pragmatism).

## Resources

I have drawn on a great many different resources to be able to compose this text. I believe you, too, may benefit from them, so I wanted to take a moment to point them out.

### Libraries

The code snippets in this book largely do not rely on libraries. Each operation that we discover, we'll derive how to implement it in standalone, plain ol' JavaScript. However, as you begin to build more of your real code with FP, you'll quickly want a library to provide optimized and highly reliable versions of these commonly accepted utilities.

By the way, you'll want to make sure you check the documentation for the library functions you use to make sure you know how they work. There will be a lot of similarities in many of them to the code we build on in this text, but there will undoubtedly be some differences, even between popular libraries.

Вот несколько популярных библиотек ФП для JavaScript, которые являются отличным началом для исследования:

* [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com)
* [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide)
* [functional.js](http://functionaljs.com/)
* [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)

Appendix C takes a deeper look at these libraries and others.

## Summary

You may have a variety reasons for starting to read this book, and different expectations of what you'll get out of it. This chapter has explained why I want you to read the book and what I want you to get out of the journey. It also helps you articulate to others (like your fellow developers) why they should come on the journey with you!

Functional programming is about writing code that is based on proven principles so we can gain a level of confidence and trust over the code we write and read. We shouldn't be content to write code that we anxiously *hope* works, and then abruptly breathe a sigh of relief when the test suite passes. We should *know* what it will do before we run it, and we should be absolutely confident that we've communicated all these ideas in our code for the benefit of other readers (including our future selves).

Это сердце функционального JavaScript. Цель в том, чтобы научиться эффективно общаться с нашим кодом, но не задыхаться под горами обозначений или терминологии, чтобы добраться туда.
This is the heart of Functional-Light JavaScript. The goal is to learn to effectively communicate with our code but not have to suffocate under mountains of notation or terminology to get there.

Путь к изучению функционального программирования начинается с глубокого понимания природы функции. Именно это мы рассмотрим в следующей главе.
